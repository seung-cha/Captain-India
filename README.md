# Latest File can be accessed in the 'lostfile' branch
I honestly think the coding architecture is too bad but who cares it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Final build + Folio and videos can be accessed via the link below

Anyone making or interested in making a game for their ITM major, I hope you guys do great.  
I hope my files help you with your project. It is up to you whether you straight up just copy my folio or just look at it as a reference. 
# Major work hasn't been marked yet
